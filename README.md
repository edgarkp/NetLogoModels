# NetLogoModels
NetLogo is a programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) for agent-based modeling. Developed on Java, it allows create to decisions model through rules of interaction that can be deterministic , stochastic or full complex logic. We are able therefore to implement dynamics in individuals behavior and find aggregate properties from them.

To illustrate it, we propose some models inspired from the Pre-conference workshop on Agent-based
Models in Economics and Finance done in 2015 at Tapei by Murat Yıldızoglu :

### 1) A financial market with zero intelligence agents : 
The idea is to represent the price dynamics under very simple market conditions according to user inputs and model parameters

### 2) An industrial dynamics model :
This model is based on the work of Nelson & Winter:

The idea is to check the influence of technical progress on industry evolution with innovation and global imitation and to understand how innovation and imitation process is implemented in a basic approach. One will also check their consequences on the industry dynamics
